                <h1>Prisoner Skill</h1>
                <p> We believe that there are a lot of prisoners out there who deserve second chances.
                    Unfortunately, there is a huge societal stigma that has been cast onto all prisoners,
                    making second chances seem impossible. We are here to break that stigma and to
                    create mutually beneficial second chances along the way. <br><a href=https://lambda-prisoner-skills.herokuapp.com/admin/

                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p>We seek to help forward-thinking inmates who are motivated to
                    better themselves and prepare for their post-prison futures. The unemployment rate is tragically
                    high for former inmates, so our goal is to give them a leg up.
                    At the same time we give them the opportunity to develop and improve their skills
                    while making some money along the way.</p>

                <h2>Did You know?</h2>
                <p>We don't always think about it, but some people out there are constantly struggling to provide for
                    their families. These people, who have the best of intentions, sometimes, resort to "illegal means"
                    just to get by and end up getting locked up. This is what we call, poverty related crime.

            <section class="box three">
                <h2>Why We Care!</h2>
                <p>We want to do our part to embetter society as a whole. Every person has the capacity to contribute
                    to, to negatively effect and to do nothing for our communities. Our program enables prisoners to be
                    productive members of society while they are locked up and increases the likliehood that they will continue to
                    do so afterwards as well.</p>

                <h2>An Entrepreneur's Perspective</h2>
                <p>“The first thing that struck me when I entered was the fact that it felt like a village. These were ordinary women 
                    who had to provide for their families and ended up committing crimes such as drug trafficking or theft.”

                <h2>A Prisoner's Testimonial</h2>
                <p>"My prison job made me feel like I was fulfilling my existential duty to society: I was contributing. It doesn't surprise me that prison work assignments are credited with reducing recidivism.
                Any change for good that happened within me while I was incarcerated grew out of my job. If I feel that way about my time making chicken a la king, an inmate who's saving lives fighting fires must feel it 10 times over."
